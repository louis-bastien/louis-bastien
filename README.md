# üëã Hi, I'm Louis Bastien

I'm a **founder-turned-software engineer** with over 10 years of experience in infrastructure, server management, and web hosting. After running my own hosting company (Obambu) serving 2,000+ clients, I transitioned into a hands-on engineering role, focusing on automation, backend systems, and cloud-native tooling.

I recently completed an intensive full-time program at **42 School**, where I worked on projects ranging from low-level C to full-stack web apps and DevOps challenges. Today, I‚Äôm building secure, scalable applications using **Python**, **Docker**, and **AWS**, and deepening my expertise in **Terraform**, **Kubernetes**, and **CI/CD pipelines**.

Whether it‚Äôs deploying a production-ready infrastructure or building backend APIs, I enjoy solving technical problems across the stack with a mix of pragmatic engineering and product awareness.

## üöÄ Projects

### Transcendence 
[![Repo](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-Transcendence-blue?logo=github)](https://github.com/louis-bastien/ft_transcendence-showcase)

A **multiplayer Pong web app** with:
- **Full-stack**: Django (backend) + JavaScript/HTML/CSS (front-end)  
- **Docker**: Containerized services with dedicated environment for dev and prod. 
- **AWS deployment**: EC2 hosting, S3 for storage (Vault secrets). Automatic deployment via GithubActions.
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus/Grafana setup with Alerting rules
- Contributed to backend and frontend development: implemented language-switch functionality using Python i18n libraries and made improvements to the front-end interface and styling.

---

### cPsentry 
[![Repo](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-cPsentry-blue?logo=github)](https://github.com/louis-bastien/cPsentry)

A **custom server monitoring/security tool** for cPanel and KVM-based infra:
- **Python** + **Flask** + some **Bash**  
- Tracks mail queues, DB status, Apache health, filesystem usage  
- Telegram alerts and dynamic IP blocking with iptables  

---

### Inception 
[![Repo](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-Inception-blue?logo=github)](https://github.com/louis-bastien/inception)

Multi-container **Docker Compose** project simulating a production-like local hosting environment:
- Hosts **WordPress (PHP-FPM)**, **Redis** caching, **MariaDB**, Adminer, FTP, **MailHog**, and a static site built with **HTML/Tailwind CSS**  
- Demonstrates container orchestration, network isolation, volume persistence, and SSL configuration  
- Focused on modular service design and local development workflows

### Minishell & IRC

[![Minishell](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-Minishell-blue?logo=github)](https://github.com/louis-bastien/minishell)
[![IRC](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-IRC-blue?logo=github)](https://github.com/louis-bastien/IRC)

- **Minishell**: A tiny Unix shell in C, managing signals, redirections, pipes, and built-in commands  
- **IRC**: A socket-based IRC server in C++, handling concurrency (epoll), RFC compliance, and network protocols  

These projects showcase my **C/C++** skills and low-level understanding of Unix systems.

---

## üå± Current Focus

- **Infrastructure as Code**: Learning Terraform to provision cloud infrastructure in a repeatable, scalable way  
- **Container Orchestration**: Exploring Kubernetes and Helm for production-grade service deployment and scaling  
- **Secrets Management**: Moving from entrypoint-based Vault injection to using the **Vault Agent Sidecar Injector** for more secure and maintainable secret delivery  
- **Tooling Improvements**: Actively extending `cPsentry` with:
  - Safer `iptables` interactions (manual IP unblocking + better control)
  - Unifying monitoring for both **KVM hypervisors** and **cPanel servers** into a single app
