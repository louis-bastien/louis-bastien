### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Louis Bastien

I'm a founder-turned-engineer with a strong background in infrastructure, server management, and backend development. After running a hosting company (Obambu) serving 2,000+ clients, Iâ€™ve shifted my focus to DevOps and backend engineering â€” combining years of real-world infrastructure experience with modern tooling.
