# 👋 Hi, I'm Louis Bastien

I'm a **founder-turned-software engineer** with over 10 years of experience in infrastructure, server management, and web hosting. After running Obambu, a hosting company serving 2,000+ clients, I transitioned into hands-on engineering—building backend systems, web apps, and automation tools.

At **42 School**, I’ve completed projects ranging from low-level C/C++ system programming to full-stack web applications using **Python**, **Django**, and **JavaScript**. I’ve developed REST APIs, real-time features, and scalable backend logic—deploying services with **Docker**, **CI/CD pipelines**, and AWS.

I'm currently:
- Deepening my full-stack skills with **Node.js** and **TypeScript**
- Adding **Redis Pub/Sub** and **Celery** into personal tools like `cPsentry`
- Learning **Terraform** and **Kubernetes** for production-ready infrastructure
