# üëã Hi, I'm Louis Bastien

I'm a **founder-turned-software engineer** with over 10 years of experience in infrastructure, server management, and web hosting. After running Obambu, a hosting company serving 2,000+ clients, I transitioned into hands-on engineering‚Äîbuilding backend systems, web apps, and automation tools.

At **42 School**, I‚Äôve completed projects ranging from low-level C/C++ system programming to full-stack web applications using **Python**, **Django**, and **JavaScript**. I‚Äôve developed REST APIs, real-time features, and scalable backend logic‚Äîdeploying services with **Docker**, **CI/CD pipelines**, and AWS.

I'm currently:
- Deepening my full-stack skills with **Node.js** and **TypeScript**
- Adding **Redis Pub/Sub** and **Celery** into personal tools like `cPsentry`
- Learning **Terraform** and **Kubernetes** for production-ready infrastructure

## üöÄ Projects

### Transcendence 
[![Repo](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-Transcendence-blue?logo=github)](https://github.com/louis-bastien/ft_transcendence-showcase)

A **multiplayer Pong web app** with:
- **Full-stack**: Django (backend) + JavaScript/HTML/CSS (frontend)
- **Docker**: Containerized services with dedicated environments for dev and prod
- **AWS deployment**: EC2 hosting, S3 for storage (Vault secrets), automatic deployment via GitHub Actions
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus/Grafana setup with alerting rules
- Developed both **local (offline)** and **remote (online)** multiplayer game logic, using **WebSockets** for real-time sync
- Contributed to backend and frontend: implemented language-switch functionality using Python i18n and improved interface design and UX
---

### cPsentry 
[![Repo](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-cPsentry-blue?logo=github)](https://github.com/louis-bastien/cPsentry)

A **custom server monitoring/security tool** for cPanel and KVM-based infra:
- **Python** + **Flask** + some **Bash**  
- Tracks mail queues, DB status, Apache health, filesystem usage  
- Telegram alerts and dynamic IP blocking with iptables  

---

### Inception 
[![Repo](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-Inception-blue?logo=github)](https://github.com/louis-bastien/inception)

Multi-container **Docker Compose** project simulating a production-like local hosting environment:
- Hosts **WordPress (PHP-FPM)**, **Redis** caching, **MariaDB**, Adminer, FTP, **MailHog**, and a static site built with **HTML/Tailwind CSS**  
- Demonstrates container orchestration, network isolation, volume persistence, and SSL configuration  
- Focused on modular service design and local development workflows

### Minishell & IRC

[![Minishell](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-Minishell-blue?logo=github)](https://github.com/louis-bastien/minishell)
[![IRC](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-IRC-blue?logo=github)](https://github.com/louis-bastien/IRC)

- **Minishell**: A tiny Unix shell in C, managing signals, redirections, pipes, and built-in commands  
- **IRC**: A socket-based IRC server in C++, handling concurrency (epoll), RFC compliance, and network protocols  

These projects showcase my **C/C++** skills and low-level understanding of Unix systems.

## üå± Current Focus

- **Infrastructure as Code**: Learning Terraform to provision cloud infrastructure in a repeatable, scalable way  
- **Container Orchestration**: Exploring Kubernetes and Helm for production-grade service deployment and scaling  
- **Secrets Management**: Moving from entrypoint-based Vault injection to using the **Vault Agent Sidecar Injector** for more secure and maintainable secret delivery  
- **Tooling Improvements**: Actively extending [cPsentry](https://github.com/louis-bastien/cPsentry) with:
  - Safer `iptables` interactions (manual IP unblocking + better control)
  - Unifying monitoring for both **KVM hypervisors** and **cPanel servers** into a single app
